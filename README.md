Movie recommendation system

I developed a user-friendly movie recommendation system that
enables users to input movie names and receive personalized movie
suggestions.
This system leverages advanced collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.
Tools used : Python, the Scikit-learn library (sklearn), Streamlit forthe user interface, and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to enhance the recommendation engine

Note: In this project i only uploaded the code of data modeling and the model , movies.pkl is the model i deployed as u can see in noteCode folder, the data set i used for this is tmdb dataset (you can access the data set in the data sets folder)
